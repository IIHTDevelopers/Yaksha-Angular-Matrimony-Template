* You can follow series of command to setup Angular environment once you are in your project-name folder:

	npm install -> Will install all dependencies -> takes 10 to 15 min

	npm run start -> To compile and deploy the project in browser. You can press <Ctrl> key while clicking on localhost:4200 to open project in browser -> takes 2 to 3 min

	npm run start:server -> As we are using a json server to mimic our db.json file as a database. So, this command is useful to start a json server.

	npm run jest -> To run all test cases and check the summary. It is mandatory to run this command before submission of workspace -> takes 5 to 6 min  

	npm run test -> To run all test cases. It is mandatory to run this command before submission of workspace -> takes 5 to 6 min  

* To ensure your code is saved and available for later use, remember to use the CTRL+Shift+B command on your code IDE.
   This will push or save the updated contents in the internal git/repository.
   It is also important to use CTRL+Shift+B before the final submission to evaluate the code quality.
